== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [[Repository:robwebset]]
<br />
<br />
TvTunes Screensaver is a versatile screensaver that can be used to:
* View artwork for TV Shows and Movies
* Play TV or Movie themes while showing artwork
* Show a set of different images in various display formats

It was originally designed to work well with [[Add-on:TvTunes|TvTunes]] but can also be used to just display images if you would rather theme audio was not played in the background.
