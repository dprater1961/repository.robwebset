== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [[Repository:robwebset]]
<br />
<br />
The AddonSync service allows you to set one of your Kodi installations as the "Master" and have all the other installations be Slaves. Then you can have the master installation upload to a network share, and the slave installation download them.
<br />
<br />
== Setup ==
AddonSync works on a "Master" and "Slave" approach. There can be only a single Master installation, and any number of slave installations. First set up the Master installation, this will backup all of your addon settings to a shared location.
<br />
<br />
Once you have your Master installation backing up it's settings to a shared location you can configure any number of other installations to act as slaves and update their own settings from the master copy.
<br />
<br />
== Exclusions ==
There are some addons that will not be sync'ed between installations, this is normally because they need to have their own configurations, these include:
* Skin settings
* Metadata addons
* Built in screensavers
* Addons where the versions of the addon do not match
