== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [[Repository:robwebset]]
<br />
<br />
The Suitability addon allows you to get an "overview" of the content of a movie, things like the sex/violence/language content, so you can make a judgement as to the suitability for your children. (Or your grandmother!)

The addon uses the following sites to retrieve information:
* [http://www.kids-in-mind.com Kids-In-Mind]
* [http://www.commonsensemedia.org Common Sense Media]
* [http://www.dove.org The Dove Foundation]
* [http://www.movieguide.org Movie Guide]

Suitability allows you to view a summary star rating of the movie content and then drill down to view the detailed text description of the movies content. It is available via the movie context menu or launched from the Kodi Programs section (where you will be prompted for a movie name to search for) or there is also an option in settings to add it to the Confluence Movie Information Dialog.
<br />
<br />
== Summary Display ==
The summary screen shows a star rating, the categories for each provider will differ as each source site is slightly different.

== Details Display ==
The details screen will describe the content of the film to give you a better understanding of the rating available via the summary screen.
