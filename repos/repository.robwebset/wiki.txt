= Why? =

Some people may wonder why these addons are not in the official repository. The majority of them used to be, however after several repository rule changes after they were in the official repository I couldn't keep the feature rich functionality in tacked while keeping them in the official repository (Mainly due to a change in Keymap rules). So I decided it would be easier for everyone to just have them in my own repository.
